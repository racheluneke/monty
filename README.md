`monty` is an interpreter of Monty ByteCodes files, which is a scripting language just like Python.

This is a language that contains specific instructions to manipulate data information (stacks or queues), where each instruction (*called opcode*) is sended per line. Files which contains Monty byte codes usually have the `.m` extension.

Example (`file.m`):
```bash
$ cat file.m

push 0
push 1
push 2
# Printing all elements
pall
push 3
push 4
pop
# Rotating the stack to the bottom
rotr
pall
rotl
# Setting FIFO
queue
push 5
# Setting LIFO
stack
push 5
$
